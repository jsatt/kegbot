* Temperature reading
* Pluggable backend for running on different platforms (Raspberry Pi, Cubie, Edison, etc.)
* Support multiple flow meters inputs, limited only by the platform GPIO
* Interface for displaying keg stats (amount in keg, style, ABV, etc) in real time
* Track recipe, batch, style, abv, stats for display
* Web admin interface for easy management of all manual input data
* Pluggable backend for reporting stats to other systems (statsd?)
